    "# Welcome to the final capstone project!\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to combine everything you've learned and build a substantial Node.js application that showcases your intermediate skills. This project will be the crown jewel of your portfolio, demonstrating your mastery of Node.js, advanced programming patterns, and project management skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** the next sprint will detail your next steps as you complete the course and does not contain additional learning material or graded projects \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project offers flexibility. You can continue developing your existing capstone project or start with a clean sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are building on your previous capstone project, specify that in your Turing College submission and inform your reviewer. Failing to do so will result in a failed project or a severe grade reduction. If you are building on top of a previously deployed project, you must also deploy this capstone project. In other cases, this is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node.js TypeScript Backend\n",
    "- Frontend or any other way to interact with the backend\n",
    "- README file with project description and setup instructions\n",
    "- Use of OOP/FP Patterns when they make your code more expressive, generic, and easier to understand and change\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to integrate at least 1 - 2 new concepts from Module 4, choosing from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Buffers and Streams for real-time data processing\n",
    "- Queues for task management - processing data in the background, long-running, recurring tasks, etc.\n",
    "- MongoDB (or other NoSQL DB) for loosely structured data or non-relational data\n",
    "- WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates\n",
    "- LLMs for natural language processing\n",
    "- Vector database for similarity search, recommendations, embeddings, or other advanced use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects started from scratch need to integrate **at least one** new concept. Projects built on the previous capstone must incorporate **at least two** new concepts. At the same time, your project should have a few more minor supporting features. The goal is to build a project that addresses a real-world problem and demonstrates your ability to **combine your existing knowledge from previous modules with new tools and patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to research and include other technologies that align with your project goals. The goal is to experiment, push boundaries, and demonstrate your ability to learn and apply new concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you should include sufficient presentation materials (ERD, flow chart, illustrations, slides) to clearly and quickly communicate the project's purpose and functionality. You are heavily encouraged to prepare a clear plan for how you will present your project so you never seem lost or unsure of what to show or talk about next. Also, a short 15-minute presentation rehearsal is the best bang-for-your-buck investment you can make to elevate your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewer Role\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are presenting your project to a tech company's product owner. The PO was on vacation and left you responsible for leading a new experimental project. The product owner will assess how well you have integrated the latest concepts and managed the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes for the reviewer**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a learner informs you that they are building on top of their previous capstone project, you should expect a higher level of complexity and integration of new concepts.\n",
    "- You should ask which features are new and which are carried over from the previous project. You can also ask for the previous project's repository link to verify the learner's claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the key features of your application?\n",
    "- How does your application leverage some non-trivial Node concepts and patterns?\n",
    "- How have you planned out and managed your project? Have you applied any Agile principles?\n",
    "- How did you approach testing some of the more complex parts of your application?\n",
    "- What are the limitations of your current implementation? How would you address these shortcomings, if needed?\n",
    "- What are the most important things you've learned during this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functionality and Purpose. The project fulfills its intended purpose and solves a problem that could be useful in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "- Testing. The project has a comprehensive test suite covering key backend functionality and easy-to-spot edge cases. The learner can explain why they have chosen to use (or not use) specific types of tests.\n",
    "- Code Readability. Clean, formatted code with a consistent code style that follows best practices and uses intermediate OOP, FP, and TypeScript concepts when appropriate.\n",
    "- Concept Integration. The learner has applied and pointed out at least 1 concept/tool introduced in Module 4 from the provided list in the project description. Projects building on top of previous capstones must integrate at least two new concepts.\n",
    "- Presentation. The learner explained the project's purpose and technical choices and clearly, concisely, and engagingly demonstrated its functionality. The learner has prepared sufficient instructions in the README file. The learner has prepared some presentation materials (frontend, slides, graphs, illustrations, etc.) to present the project.\n",
    "- General Knowledge. The learner has no issues answering questions about their project, technologies, and potential solutions for proposed problems.\n",
    "- Documented use of Agile tools. When prompted, the learner can explain how they have applied Agile principles in their project beyond project management tools. There is clear evidence of using Scrum or Kanban tools, task estimations, progress tracking, and a well-written project retrospective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate Fail Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not disclosing that the project is a continuation of a previous capstone project\n",
    "- Failing any criteria in the project evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Inappropriate or disrespectful behavior\n",
    "- Plagiarism. You can use TC-provided boilerplate templates, attributed code snippets (such as from GitHub lists, StackOverflow, etc.), or other sources for code snippets with proper attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a back-end project, the frontend is optional. However, if you do not include a frontend, you must provide a way and clear instructions on how to interact with your backend. If you include a frontend, it can be a simple HTML/CSS/JS application or a more complex framework like React, Angular, or Vue. Your UX/UI design and frontend test coverage will not be evaluated, but it can be an excellent addition to your project for some leniency in other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your files to the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include a comprehensive README explaining the project, setup instructions, key technologies, and how to interact with the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone is your opportunity to showcase the culmination of your Node.js journey. Embrace the challenge, be creative, and build a project highlighting your abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated time to complete: 60+ hours\n"
